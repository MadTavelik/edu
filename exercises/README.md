# Exercises

Many of the exercises in this directory contain BOTH the prompts AND the solutions. READ the prompts carefully -- they will advise you when it's safe to look at a file for guidance and when you should NOT look at a file because it is the answer. Answers should only be reviewed AFTER the exercise, unless otherwise noted.
